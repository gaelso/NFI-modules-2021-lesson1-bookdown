# A new land has emerged {#newland}

`r ifelse(book_format == "html" & with_watermark, "<div class='watermark'>DRAFT</div>", "")`

An island previously unknown to humankind has just been discovered and you are part of a team of scientists commissioned to inventory its forest resources, mainly its carbon stock.

```{r makeland, echo=F}

## fixed profile - more profiles to be implemented in V2.0
newland_name <- "Louland"

sf_lc     <- sf_lc1
sf_admin  <- sf_adm1
sf_topo   <- sf_topo1
path_data <- "data/louland"
pal       <- palette1
``` 

::::::{.infobox data-latex=""}

In a future version of this interactive training module, you will be able to choose different land profiles with different (1) forest categories, (2) ratio of ocean covering the 90 x 90 km square frame in which the new land is created, (3) inclusion or exclusion of mangrove forests and even (4) the maximum altitude of ```r newland_name``` (it will have an impact on inaccessible plots)!

For now, ```r newland_name``` forests are divided into ```r nb_ft + 1``` categories: Evergreen forest, Mixed-Deciduous forest, Deciduous forest, Other Woodland and Mangrove Forest, also all the island is considered accessible.

Here is what ```r newland_name``` looks like.


```{r showland, echo=F, fig.cap="Aerial view of the new land."}

if (book_format != "html") {
  
  knitr::include_graphics(file.path(path_data, "newland.png"))
  
} 

```


```{r showland2, echo=F, results='asis', eval=knitr::is_html_output(), fig.cap="Overview of the new land."}

cat(paste0('
<center>
<video width="800" height="600" autoplay loop>
  <source src="', file.path(path_data, "newland.mp4"), '" type="video/mp4">

    '))

```


The remote sensing team has developed land cover and topographic maps based on 30m resolution remote sensing images and initial forest plot measurements taken by the first exploration crew. Based on their observations, we will be able to have a general understanding of ```r newland_name```'s forest cover. This data is called **auxiliary data**, it is not NFI data *per se*, but useful information to help design and implement an NFI.

In the next section, we will have a quick look at the exploration crew's forest inventory data, loaded in R as objects with the `exfi` prefix, and we will use the land cover maps to calculate the area of the main land cover types.
