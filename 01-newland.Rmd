# A new land has emerged {#newland}

`r ifelse(book_format == "html" & with_watermark, "<div class='watermark'>DRAFT</div>", "")`

An island previously unknown to humankind has just been discovered and you are part of a team of scientists commissioned to inventory its forest resources, mainly its carbon stock.

```{r makeland, echo=F}

## fixed profile - more profiles to be implemented in V2.0
newland_name <- "Louland"

sf_lc     <- sf_lc1
sf_admin  <- sf_adm1
sf_topo   <- sf_topo1
path_data <- "data/louland"
pal       <- palette1
``` 

::::::{.infobox data-latex=""}

In a future version of this interactive training module, you will be able to choose different land profiles with different (1) forest categories, (2) ratio of ocean covering the 90 x 90 km square frame in which the new land is created, (3) inclusion or not of mangrove forests and even (4) the maximum altitude of ```r newland_name``` (it will have an impact on inaccessible plots)!

For now, ```r newland_name``` forests are divided into ```r nb_ft``` categories: Evergreen forest, Mixed-Deciduous forest, Deciduous forest, Open Woodland, Other Non-forest land plus Mangrove Forest and all the island is considered accessible.

::::::


Here is what ```r newland_name``` looks like.


```{r showland, echo=F, fig.cap="Aerial view of the new land."}

if (book_format != "html") {
  
  knitr::include_graphics(file.path(path_data, "newland.png"))
  
} 

```


```{r showland2, echo=F, results='asis', eval=knitr::is_html_output(), fig.cap="Overview of the new land."}

cat(paste0('
<center>
<video width="800" height="600" autoplay loop>
  <source src="', file.path(path_data, "newland.mp4"), '" type="video/mp4">

    '))

```


The remote sensing team has developed land cover and topographic maps based on 30 m resolution remote sensing images and a first exploration crew measured a few forest plots. Based on their observations, we will be able to have a quick overview of ```r newland_name```. This data is call **auxiliary data**, it is not NFI data *per se*, but useful information to help designing and implementing an NFI.

In the next section, we will have a quick look at both the exploration crew's forest inventory data, loaded in R as objects with the `exfi` prefix, and we will use the land cover maps to calculate the area of the main land cover types.
