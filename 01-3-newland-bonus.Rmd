## Bonus

Before moving on with the <txt-green>sampling design</txt-green>, here is a dynamic view of ```r newland_name``` and the first 10 forest inventory plots.

```{r tmap1, echo=F, fig.cap="Land cover and first inventory plot location."}

if (book_format == "html") tmap_mode("view") else tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(sf_lc) + tm_polygons(col = "lc", 
                              palette = pal, 
                              popup.vars = c("lc", "id"), border.alpha = 0) +
tm_shape(sf_fi) + tm_dots(col = "plot_agb", 
                          size = 0.1)

```
